## ðŸ§  Assignment

Your task is simple â€” show that you can use VS Code and GitHub confidently!

Create a new repository on your GitHub account.

Inside it, add a text file named introduction.txt.

In that file, write a short introduction about yourself (name, major, and why youâ€™re learning programming).

Commit your changes and push them to your repository.

Make sure your repo is public so we can view it.


## âœ… Submission

Once youâ€™ve completed your task, share your repository link in the GitHub assignment form or post it in the Teams chat (depending on instructions given).
